## Demonstration
A video demonstration of the 3D painting is given [here](https://youtu.be/-p0TFiVBBxI "3D Touch Sensitive Painting").

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to help people who are visually impaired learn about music. The painting has 3D paint so the user can feel the shape of the different music notes, and as they touch it the note will repeatedly play.\
This product uses a 4/4 scale and allows the user to touch and hear a:\
  + Whole note (4 beats)
  + Half note(2 beats)
  + Quarter note(1 beat)
  + Eighth note(½ beat)
  + Sixteenth note(¼ beat)\
  
This product not only will help visually impaired people, but is also intriguing to children who may or may not be visually 
impaired and can help them learn how musical notes sound and what they look like.
